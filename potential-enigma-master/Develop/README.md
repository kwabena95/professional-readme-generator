  # README

  ## Description
  There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.
    
  ## Table of Contents (Optional)
  If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
  * [Description](#description)
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [Credits](#credit)
  * [License](#license)
  * [Features](#feature)
  * [Contributions](#contribution)
  * [Tests](#test)
 

   
    
  ## Installation
  * At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?
